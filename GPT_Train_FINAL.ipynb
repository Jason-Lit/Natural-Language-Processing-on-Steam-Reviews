The only complaint is that there isn\\'t more to it. ; Its like doom eternal for kids its kinda fire tho ; While graphically impressive and introducing some interesting mechanics, the game suffers too greatly from being lacking in variety. Locations feel small and are far too few, and combat is repetitive with fewer types of enemies than in previous full length games. Collectibles are far too easy to find and give unsatisfying rewards, many just being straight up given to you without any effort required.'''"

            "Give a pro and con of the following reviews: I absolutely love Ratchet & Clank. I've played all the games and for the longest time it was the only reason I owned a PlayStation. Now I've gotten rid of the PlayStation. The game is everything I expected from the series and it was good fun. The only complaint is that there isn't more to it. ; Its like doom eternal for kids its kinda fire tho ; While graphically impressive and introducing some interesting mechanics, the game suffers too greatly from being lacking in variety. Locations feel small and are far too few, and combat is repetitive with fewer types of enemies than in previous full length games. Collectibles are far too easy to find and give unsatisfying rewards, many just being straight up given to you without any effort required.\n",

            "Give a pro and con of the following reviews: I absolutely love Ratchet & Clank. I've played all the games and for the longest time it was the only reason I owned a PlayStation. Now I've gotten rid of the PlayStation. The game is everything I expected from the series and it was good fun. The only complaint is that there isn't more to it. ; Its like doom eternal for kids its kinda fire tho ; While graphically impressive and introducing some interesting mechanics, the game suffers too greatly from being lacking in variety. Locations feel small and are far too few, and combat is repetitive with fewer types of enemies than in previous full length games. Collectibles are far too easy to find and give unsatisfying rewards, many just being straight up given to you without any effort required.\n",
            "I bought this game because I was looking forward to playing a game that i had never played before. My first thought was this game is fun, but the controls are complicated beyond words. It's like playing a video game. I think it's fun to play, but I feel a bit antiquated at the game. I think it's very difficult, but it's also fun to play. I would say I'd have a hard time with it if I didn't play it.  I would recommend this game before buying a PS4, as it is still very fun, but there are some bugs that need to be addressed or fixed.\n",
            "All in all, are you a good person?  I like this game. I love the story, the art, the soundtrack, the voice acting and the characters. I am also happy with the songs and the music. I feel like it does a great job of keeping the game simple and enjoyable.  I can't wait to play it\n"
